# CodeQuiz

## Task

At some point in my journey to become a full-stack web developer, I'll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment could be a quiz consisting of both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To practice my coding skills I built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## Description

```
When the user clicks the start button a timer starts and a question is rendered to the screen
When the user answers a question the program will check the answer and render the next question to the screen
If the user chose the wrong answer 2 seconds will be subtracted from the timer
When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the quiz will end.
When the quiz is over the user can input their initials and save their score
The user can also view all their scores by clicking the view high scores button
